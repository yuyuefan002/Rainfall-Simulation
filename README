fmin runs a long time, should use std::min instead.

when input size < 128, absrob and trickaway run longest time
when input size >=128, for loops in runOneTimestamp run longest time.

Therefore, it is a good choice to parallel for loops for absorb() and trickaway().

overhead is too big, so, this method doesn't work.

because only trickleaway method has the race condition of delta matrix.
Therefore, we can parallel the whole process, only lock for the race condition and apply barrier.

vector will slow down parallel processes.

Abstractions will slow down parallel processes, even parameters are passed by references.

the -pg flag will largely slows down parallel. Maybe this is the key reason.
